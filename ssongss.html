        <p>I trip and fall in love just like a Tuesday drunk<br>
I always go all in, all in, all in<br>
Over the handlebars, hittin' the ground so hard<br>
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin'<br>
We ain't gotta talk about it<br>
Mercy<br>
Why is it love is never kind to me?<br>
I heard that fools rush in, and, yeah, that's me<br>
It burns me time and time again<br>
So why am I still fixing for this frying pan? (Oh)<br>
Thinkin', I wonder what you're doin' for tonight and forever (oh)<br>
I could be the rest of your life or whatever (ooh-ooh)<br>
My lips and your lips, we could press them together ('gether, 'gether, 'gether)<br>
I don't ever think twice (twice)<br>
And, baby, that's why</p>

<p>I trip and fall in love just like a Tuesday drunk<br>
I always go all in, all in, all in<br>
Over the handlebars, hittin' the ground so hard<br>
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin'</p>

<p>Another round, another drink<br>
I try to stop, but I can't think<br>
About anything else but you<br>
And I'm a little too buzzed on your love to play it cute<br>
A single kiss, I lost my mind<br>
For seven days and seven nights<br>
Can't eat, sleep, baby, it's true<br>
Tryna bite my lip, I'm probably gonna slip<br>
And say some crazy shit to you</p>

<p>I wonder what you're doin' for tonight and forever (oh)<br>
I don't ever think twice<br>
And, baby, that's why</p>

<p>I trip and fall in love just like a Tuesday drunk<br>
I always go all in, all in (all in), all in<br>
Over the handlebars, hittin' the ground so hard<br>
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin' (yeah)<br>
We ain't gotta talk about it<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (yeah)<br>
We ain't gotta talk about it<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
We ain't gotta talk about it</p>

        <p>Feeling kind of sick tonight<br>
All I've had is coffee and leftover pie<br>
It's no wonder why<br>
Ooh, still you take up all my mind<br>
I don't even think that you care like I do<br>
I should stop, heaven knows I've tried</p>

<p>One day, I will stop falling in love with you<br>
Some day, someone will like me like I like you<br>
Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie<br>
Pretend that we are more than friends<br>
Then, of course, I'll let you break my heart again</p>

<p>I'm just tryna understand what I am to you<br>
More than songs, we've exchanged<br>
Midnight calls, sunset views<br>
Promise I don't mean to cry<br>
But I get overwhelmed and confused<br>
If only you knew what I felt like</p>

<p>One day, I will stop falling in love with you<br>
Some day, someone will like me like I like you<br>
Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie<br>
Pretend that we are more than friends<br>
Then, of course, I'll let you break my heart again</p>

<p>Some day, one day, I will stop falling in love with you<br>
Until I do, I'll be thinking of you<br>
Let you break my heart again</p>

<p>
They say I'm too young to love you<br>
I don't know what I need<br>
They think I don't understand<br>
The freedom land of the seventies<br>
I think I'm too cool to know ya<br>
You say I'm like the ice, I freeze<br>
I'm churning out novels like<br>
Beat poetry on amphetamines
</p>

<p>
I say<br>
I say
</p>

<p>
Well, my boyfriend's in a band<br>
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed<br>
I've got feathers in my hair<br>
I get down to Beat poetry<br>
And my jazz collection's rare<br>
I can play most anything<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby

<p>
They say I'm too young to love you<br>
They say I'm too dumb to see<br>
They judge me like a picture book<br>
By the colors, like they forgot to read<br>
I think we're like fire and water<br>
I think we're like the wind and sea<br>
You're burning up, I'm cooling down<br>
You're up, I'm down<br>
You're blind, I see
</p>

<p>
But I'm free, ooh<br>
I'm free
</p>

<p>
Well, my boyfriend's in a band<br>
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed<br>

And my jazz collection's rare<br>
I can play most anything<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby
</p>

<p>
I'm talking 'bout my generation<br>
I'm talking 'bout my newer nation<br>
And if you don't like it, you can beat it<br>
Beat it, baby<br>
You never liked the way I said it<br>
If you don't get it, then forget<br>
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it
</p>

<p>
And my boyfriend's in a band<br>
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed<br>
I've got feathers in my hair<br>
I get high on hydroponic weed<br>
And my jazz collection's rare<br>
I get down to Beat poetry<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby
</p>

<p>
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da<br>
Te-de-de, da-da-ah<br>
Ooh, oh, woah-ah

<p>
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool<br>
But he's not as cool as me<br>
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby<br>
I'm a Brooklyn baby

          A sea of waves we hug the same plank<br>
  (Saw your end)<br>
  Just as I'd rehearsed over in my brain<br>
  (Saw your end)<br>
  The waves suck you in and you drown<br>
  If like, you should sink down beneath<br>
  I'll swim down, would you?<br>
  You?<br>
  You hang the anchors over my neck<br>
  (Saw your end)<br>
  I liked it at first, but the more you laughed<br>
  The crazier I came<br>
  The waves suck you in then you drown<br>
  If like, you should sink down beneath<br>
  I'll swim down with you<br>
  Is that what you want?<br>
  You<br>
  Is that what you want?<br>

      <p>Wonder what I'll do when the cops come through<br>
      And the whiskey's run out<br>
      'Cause I've been lookin' at you since half past two<br>
      Wanna take this downtown?<br>
      This liquid courage got me way too honest<br>
      Put your phone on vibrate<br>
      Let's catch a vibe babe while the sun's down<br>
      Hush now, I know we're a little too fucked up to stay still, love<br>
      Be as quiet as you can 'cause if anyone sees they'll just blow shit up<br>
      I don't gotta know if you're taken<br>
      I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant<br>
      No one's gotta know, just us and the moon 'til the sun starts waking<br>
      Up's the only direction I see</p>

      <p>As long as we keep this<br>
      Low-low-low-low, low-low-low lowkey (Ah, ah)<br>
      You ain't even gotta lo-lo-lo-lo<br>
      Lo-lo-lo-love me (Ah, ah)<br>
      Us in a king-size, keep it a secret<br>
      Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this<br>
      Low-low-low-low, low-low-low lowkey</p>

      <p>Wizard with words, tellin' me my energy's so bewitching<br>
      So I'll go first, there's an open bar, let's close this distance<br>
      Oh my, don't make me have to spell it all night<br>
      I don't really give a fuck about all the "He said, she said" bullshit<br>
      So pick your poison love, let's go somewhere a little more exclusive<br>
      Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand boy<br>
      Tension so intense like an asteroid<br>
      Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids<br>
      Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems</p>

      <p>So long as we keep this<br>
      Low-low-low-low, low-low-low lowkey (Ah, ah)<br>
      You ain't even gotta lo-lo-lo-lo<br>
      Lo-lo-lo-love me (Ah, ah)<br>
      Us in a king-size, keep it a secret<br>

      <p>I'm going back to 505<br>
      If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
      In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side<br>
      With your hands between your thighs</p>

      <p>Stop and wait a sec<br>
      Oh when you look at me like that my darling<br>
      What did you expect?<br>
      I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br>
      Or I did last time I checked</p>

      <p>Not shy of a spark<br>
      A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark<br>
      Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark<br>
      Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start</p>

      <p>I'm going back to 505<br>
      If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
      In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side<br>
      With your hands between your thighs</p>

      <p>But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
      It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"<br>
      I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise<br>
      Take my hands off of your eyes too soon</p>

      <p>I'm going back to 505<br>
      If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
      In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side<br>
      With your hands between your thighs</p>
